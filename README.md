# Quora_Classification
Quora  is  an  American  question  and  answer  website  where questions  are  asked  and  edited  by  the  Internet  users,  in  the  form  of  opinions, which include questions  that are  harmful  to  our  community,  and should be removed before  they  have  a  chance  to  cause  harm(or  spawn  imitators).   The   entire  project  would  be  consisting  of  predicting  sincerity  of  questions  on  Quora.  The  dataset  concerned  here,  consists of  over  1.3  million  questions,  having  the  opportunity  to  train  and  test  models,  to  detect  insincerity  and  trolling  based  on real  Quora  questions.  In  conjunction   with  dataset,  the project  would be  focused   on  solving  this  problem.  We  have  used  machine  learning  involving  classification  for  the  same.  The  entire  project  duration  consists  of  training  the  available  dataset  with  appropriate  algorithms,  to  develop  a  model,  and  then   testing  the  model  with  appropriate  test  dataset. The aim of the analysis is to provide a safe and legit content website for Quora's 300 million monthly users. Count Vectorizer model was developed for each question, which was then fitted to Logistic Regression model, which classified the unseen questions with about 91 % accuracy.
